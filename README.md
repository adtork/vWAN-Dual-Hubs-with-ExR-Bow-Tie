# vWAN-Dual-Hubs-with-ExpressRoute-Bow-Tie

# Intro
In this article we are going to explore multiple traffic scenarios with vWAN hubs and express-route circuits. I will show various scenarios with circuits hooked to single vhub, then move to multiple vhubs and doing bow-tie. We will also toggle the Hub Routing Preference (HRP) on/off for each vhub and show how that effets the route and AS-PATH
